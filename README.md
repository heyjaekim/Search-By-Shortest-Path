# Search-By-Shortest-Path
Implementing DFS, BFS, A-star, bi-directional BFS to find the shortest path in maze
---
*If you are having trouble viewing entire grid when running **Visualization.py**
  simply change the **width** variable in the following files: **Visualization.py**, line #:75, **Map.py**,line #:105 inside the **visualize_maze** function.This is caused by screen resolution varying per device.*

Implementing Maze On Fire, **MazeOnFire.py** by using Manhattan distance of the A* and improved DFS search algorithm. If you want to change the value for flammability, please modify the q value for each strategy function. At the end of the file, there is a function to retrieve the average success based on the probability and the q-value.
